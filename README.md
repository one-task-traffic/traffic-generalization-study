## Saving Trained Models

To ensure trained models are saved correctly, set up the following directory structure in your current working directory:

```
model_outputs/
├── model_weights/
└── full_model/
```

- `model_weights/`: where the model weights will be saved.
- `full_model/`: where the full model (architecture + weights) will be saved.

Make sure both subdirectories exist before training begins.
